# COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS-OF-SIGNAL
Conducted a comparative study of ML and DL models for radar signal classification using MATLAB-simulated data. Features included SNR, PRF, pulse width, Doppler shift, and bandwidth. RNN (97%) and CNN (95%) outperformed ML models like SVM (75%) and Random Forest (65%).
Radar signals are crucial in modern defense and surveillance systems as they enable accurate target identification. Since radar receives a variety of signals, effective classification becomes essential. This study proposes the optimal model for radar signal classification by conducting a comparative analysis of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), support vector machines (SVM), XGBoost, LightGBM, random forest, and artificial neural networks (ANN). The dataset was dynamically simulated in MATLAB with features such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), pulse repetition frequency (PRF) versus pulse width, Doppler shift, center frequency, and bandwidth. Experimental results indicate that deep learning models—particularly RNN (97% accuracy) and CNN (95% accuracy)—significantly outperform machine learning models such as random forest (65%) and SVM (75%), even after applying hyperparameter tuning

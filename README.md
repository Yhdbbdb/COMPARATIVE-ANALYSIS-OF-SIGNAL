# COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS-OF-SIGNAL
Conducted a comparative study of ML and DL models for radar signal classification using MATLAB-simulated data. Features included SNR, PRF, pulse width, Doppler shift, and bandwidth. RNN (97%) and CNN (95%) outperformed ML models like SVM (75%) and Random Forest (65%).
